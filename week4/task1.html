    <h2>Java Script History</h2>
    <p>JavaScript is a programming language that was created in 1995 by Brendan Eich while he was working at Netscape Communications Corporation. Initially, it was developed in just ten days and was originally called Mocha, then renamed to LiveScript, and finally to JavaScript. The name change was partly a marketing strategy to capitalize on the popularity of Java at the time, even though JavaScript and Java are quite different in terms of design and functionality.
        The primary purpose of JavaScript is to enable interactive web pages. It allows developers to implement complex features on web pages, such as dynamic content updates, interactive forms, animations, and multimedia handling. Over the years, JavaScript has evolved significantly, with the introduction of various frameworks and libraries like React, Angular, and Vue.js, which help streamline development and enhance user experiences.
        In the web environment, JavaScript primarily runs in the browser. When a user visits a website, the browser downloads the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, executing the JavaScript code to create a dynamic interaction with the user. Additionally, JavaScript can also run on the server side using environments like Node.js, which allows developers to use JavaScript for backend development. This versatility has made JavaScript one of the core technologies of the web, alongside HTML and CSS.</p>
