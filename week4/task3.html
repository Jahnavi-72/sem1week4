    <h2>Difference Between variables</h2>
    <p>
        1. var:
        - var is function-scoped or globally scoped, meaning if it's defined inside a function, it can only be accessed within that function. If defined outside, it can be accessed anywhere in the global context.
        - Variables declared with var can be re-declared and updated.<br><br>
     
     2. let:
        - let is block-scoped, which means it is only accessible within the block (enclosed by {}) in which it is defined.
        - Variables declared with let can be updated but not re-declared in the same scope.<br><br>
     
     3. const:
        - const is also block-scoped like let, but it is used to declare variables that cannot be reassigned after their initial assignment.
        - However, if the variable holds an object or an array, the contents of that object or array can still be modified.<br><br>
     
     These differences help in managing variable scope and immutability in JavaScript, leading to cleaner and more predictable code.</p>
